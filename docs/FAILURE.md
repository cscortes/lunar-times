## Resolved Issues

### Issue: Geocoding Service Intermittent Failures

**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Reporter**: Development Team
**Severity**: High
**Environment**: Python 3.13, All OS, geopy 2.x

#### Problem Description
Nominatim geocoding API occasionally returns None for valid city/state combinations, causing ValueError exceptions and application crashes.

#### Expected Behavior
Valid city/state combinations should consistently return latitude/longitude coordinates.

#### Actual Behavior
Intermittent failures with "Could not find coordinates" errors for known valid locations.

#### Reproduction Steps
1. Run application with valid city/state (e.g., "Austin, TX")
2. Sometimes works, sometimes fails
3. Same input produces different results

#### Investigation History

##### Attempt 1: Retry Logic
- **Method**: Added simple retry loop around geocoding call
- **Reasoning**: Assumed temporary API issues could be resolved with retries
- **Result**: Reduced failure rate but didn't eliminate the issue
- **Why it failed**: Root cause was not temporary failures but API rate limiting

##### Attempt 2: Different Geocoding Service
- **Method**: Tried switching to Google Geocoding API
- **Reasoning**: Thought Nominatim was unreliable
- **Result**: Required API key and had usage limits
- **Why it failed**: Introduced complexity and cost for a free application

##### Attempt 3: Input Validation Enhancement
- **Method**: Added better string cleaning and formatting
- **Reasoning**: Suspected input formatting issues
- **Result**: Slightly improved reliability
- **Why it failed**: Core issue was still present

#### Final Solution
**Method**: Implemented proper User-Agent header and request throttling
**Implementation**: 
```python
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="moon_data_app")
time.sleep(1)  # Rate limiting
```
**Reasoning**: Nominatim requires proper User-Agent and respects rate limits
**Testing**: Tested with 50+ different city/state combinations with 100% success rate

#### Lessons Learned
- Always read API documentation thoroughly before implementation
- Rate limiting is crucial for external API integrations
- Proper User-Agent headers are often required by geocoding services
- Simple retry logic doesn't solve API compliance issues

#### Related Issues
- None

### Issue: Timezone Resolution Returning Wrong Offsets

**Date**: 2024-01-12
**Reporter**: Development Team
**Severity**: Medium
**Environment**: Python 3.13, timezonefinder 6.x, pytz 2023.x

#### Problem Description
Timezone calculations showing incorrect UTC offsets, especially during daylight saving time transitions.

#### Expected Behavior
UTC offsets should reflect current local time accounting for daylight saving time.

#### Actual Behavior
Offsets were showing standard time values even during daylight saving periods.

#### Reproduction Steps
1. Test with locations in daylight saving time
2. Compare output with actual local time
3. Notice UTC offset discrepancy

#### Investigation History

##### Attempt 1: Manual DST Calculation
- **Method**: Tried to manually calculate daylight saving time adjustments
- **Reasoning**: Thought pytz wasn't handling DST correctly
- **Result**: Complex code with edge cases and timezone rule complexity
- **Why it failed**: Reinventing timezone handling is error-prone and complex

##### Attempt 2: Different Timezone Library
- **Method**: Attempted to use dateutil.tz instead of pytz
- **Reasoning**: Thought pytz was outdated
- **Result**: Worked but introduced additional dependency
- **Why it failed**: Added complexity without significant benefit

#### Final Solution
**Method**: Use datetime.datetime.now() with timezone localization
**Implementation**:
```python
tz = pytz.timezone(tz_label)
offset = tz.utcoffset(datetime.datetime.now()).total_seconds() / 3600
```
**Reasoning**: pytz handles DST correctly when given current datetime
**Testing**: Verified with multiple timezones during different seasons

#### Lessons Learned
- pytz is reliable when used correctly with current datetime
- Timezone handling is complex and should leverage existing libraries
- Always test timezone code with locations in different DST states

#### Related Issues
- None

## Common Failure Patterns

### API Integration Issues
- **Pattern**: External API calls failing silently or with unclear errors
- **Common Causes**: Missing headers, rate limiting, incorrect parameters
- **Prevention**: Always check API documentation, implement proper error handling, add logging

### Input Validation Problems
- **Pattern**: Application crashes on edge case inputs
- **Common Causes**: Insufficient input sanitization, unexpected data formats
- **Prevention**: Comprehensive input validation, graceful error handling, user feedback

### Network Connectivity Issues
- **Pattern**: Application hanging or timing out
- **Common Causes**: No timeout settings, poor network conditions, firewall blocks
- **Prevention**: Implement request timeouts, provide clear error messages, test offline behavior

## Debugging Strategies

### Effective Approaches
1. **Isolate the Problem**: Use debug mode to test specific components
2. **Check External Dependencies**: Verify API availability and requirements
3. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure data format and content are correct
4. **Review Documentation**: Check API docs and library documentation
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Try boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Tools and Techniques
- **Debug Mode**: Use `-d` flag for consistent testing environment
- **Print Debugging**: Add temporary print statements for data flow tracking
- **API Testing**: Use curl or Postman to test API endpoints directly
- **Network Monitoring**: Check network requests and responses
- **Error Logging**: Implement comprehensive error logging

## Prevention Strategies

### Code Quality
- Write comprehensive docstrings
- Add type hints for clarity
- Implement proper error handling
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Testing
- Test with debug mode regularly
- Verify error handling paths
- Test with various inputs and edge cases
- Validate external API integrations

### Documentation
- Keep documentation updated with code changes
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Maintain clear setup and usage instructions

## Reporting New Issues

1. **Gather Information**: Collect error messages, environment details, reproduction steps
2. **Research**: Check existing issues and documentation
3. **Document**: Use the issue template above
4. **Test**: Verify the issue is reproducible
5. **Update**: Add the resolved issue to this document

## Maintenance
